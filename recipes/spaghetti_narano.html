    <h1>Spaghetti alla Narano</h1>
    <p>Spaghetti alla Narano is a tasty, vegetarian dish</p>
    <p>Takes 8:55 hours to complete</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
        <li>Green zucchini</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.</li>
        <li>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.</li>
        <li>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil</li>
    </ol>
